# Aimeos Documentation

Everyone is invited to improve the documentation! :-)

## How to contribute

Just fork the repository, edit and add files, commit your changes and create a pull request:

![Fork Aimeos docs](https://aimeos.org/fileadmin/user_upload/aimeos-docs-repo.png)

## Local setup (optional)

Read on, if you want to know, how to edit the documentation locally using Git and preview your changes on your local machine.

### Setting up a git workflow

- Create a free github account, if you do not already have one
- Go to `https://github.com/aimeos/aimeos-docs` and fork the repo (click on the "Fork" button on the top right, see image above)
- In your terminal, clone the forked repo to a destination of your choice with:

  ```bash
  > git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT]/aimeos-docs.git
  ```

  This creates a folder called *aimeos-docs*.

- Change into your newly created local *aimeos-docs* folder and add upstream links to be able to always keep your local clone up-to-date:

  ```bash
  > cd aimeos-doc
  > git remote add upstream git://github.com/aimeos/aimeos-docs.git
  ```

  You can verify your git configuration using `git remote -v`:

  ```bash
  > git remote -v

  origin https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO>/aimeos-docs.git (fetch)
  origin https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO>/aimeos-docs.git (push)
  upstream git://github.com/aimeos/aimeos-docs.git (fetch)
  upstream git://github.com/aimeos/aimeos-docs.git (push)
  ```

  Keep your local clone and your fork up-to-date with:

  ```bash
  > git fetch upstream
  > git merge upstream/master master
  > git push
  ```

  Optional:

  ```bash
  > git rebase upstream/master
  ```

- For each change you would like to commit, create and checkout a new branch, e.g.:

  ```bash
  > git checkout -b <name-of-your-current-commit-branch>
  ```

- Edit the mardown files you wish to contribute to, add a comment and push them to your fork:

  ```bash
  > git add <the-file-you-just-edited>.md
  > git commit -m '<describe briefly, what you changed>'
  > git push -u origin <name-of-your-current-commit-branch>
  ```

- Go to your *aimeos-docs* fork in your github account and create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request ).

- Once your are finished with your commit, don't forget to switch back to the master branch in your local clone:

  ``` BASH
  > git checkout master
  ```

- Once your commit is merged, you can delete your local and remote branches again with:

  ```bash
  > git branch --delete <branch_name>
  > git push origin --delete <branch_name>
  ```

  Then update your local clone and your github fork again with:

  ```bash
  > git fetch upstream
  > git merge upstream/master master
  > git push
  ```

### Build and live reload your local clone (optional)

Contributing to *aimeos-docs* does not require anything else but editing the markdown
files. However, if you would like to run a local version of the generated docs, you
need Python 3. This enables the local generation of the complete *aimeos-docs* as well
as running a local development server that reloads automatically as soon as changes
to the repository files are detected.

#### Install Python 3

Please refer to sources on the internet for explanations on how to install Python 3 on
your operating system. One such resource would be [Real Python: Installing Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

#### Install mkdocs and required dependencies

*aimeos-docs* uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to create static html files from
markdown files. Install `mkdocs` and the dependencies required by *aimeos-docs* with `pip`:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

#### Start the local server

Run `mkdocs serve` to start a local server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Now, whenever you make
changes to any file, the server will automatically reload and display your edited version.

#### Build the docs

To build the *aimeos-docs* locally, use `mkdocs build`. You can now open the documentation
in your browser from the newly generated `<your-aimeos-docs-clone-folder>/docs`Â´s index.html.

#### Troubleshooting

Due to some configuration limits, `mkdocs serve` will tell you that it couldn't find `versions.js`.
Also, `mkdocs serve` as well as `mkdocs build` might warn about an unknown `analytics` configuration
attribute.
You can safely ignore these warnings.
