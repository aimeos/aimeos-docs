# Account

Aimeos is able to create customer accounts after placing an order automatically. The customers will get an e-mail that contains the credentials for their new accounts created by the [customer/email/account job controller](../../config/controller-jobs/customer-email.md#account).

## Structure

Account e-mails consists of a [HTML](../../config/client-html/email-account.md#name) and a [text](../../config/client-html/email-account.md#name) part. They are sent in one e-mail as alternative views and the mail clients will display the one that is preferred by the customer.

## Templates

You can adapt the templates for the HTML/text account e-mails itself and the included sections by overwriting them in your own extension or configuring alternative template names:

* [Header template](../../config/client-html/email-account.md#template-header)
* [Body template](../../config/client-html/email-account.md#template-body)
* [HTML e-mail body](../../config/client-html/email-account.md#standard/standardtemplate-body)
* [Text e-mail body](../../config/client-html/email-account.md#standard/standardtemplate-body_1)
