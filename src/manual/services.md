The service panel is dedicated to the delivery and payment options that should be available during the checkout process. A service item configures the delivery or payment provider which is responsible for the further handling of the order (i.e. the payment).

The list view provides a paged list of all available delivery and payment options in the system, which can be [filtered](filtering-lists.md) by various criteria. The most important columns are shown by default but the list of columns can be adapted via the list header. Delivery and payment options can be added or deleted using the buttons in the list. A click on the entry also opens the detail view for editing the delivery or payment item.

# Services explained

## Delivery

During the checkout process, the customer can choose between several delivery options (e.g. UPS, TNT, etc.) if they are made available by the shop owner. Each delivery option can have its own description, picture and price. You can add as many delivery options as you like.

Every delivery option needs a properly configured delivery provider. It implements the handling of the order after the payment was successful. This can be a completely manual handling, a transfer of the order to a logistic partner or an automated process for providing a customized download file to the customer. Everything that can be implemented in an algorithm is possible within a provider.

## Payment

During checkout, customers can select a payment option if provided by the shop owner. Payment options can have their own description, picture, and price.

Each payment option requires its own configured payment provider that takes care of the payment. There are two different payment processes: local and remote payments. A local payment process collects the required payment data (if any additional data is necessary) and stores it locally in the shop system. Alternatively, a remote payment provider redirects the customer to a payment gateway, which handles the payment and notifies the shop system about the result of the payment process (usually success or failure).

Extensions implementing payment providers are available, especially those using payment gateways to handle payments of customers.

!!! note
    Please don't use any payment provider that stores credit card details locally in the shop system as long as you aren't certified as PCI-compliant. For more information take a look at the website of the [PCI Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).
