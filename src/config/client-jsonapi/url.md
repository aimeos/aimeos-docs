You can specify additional options as key/value pairs used when generating
the URLs, like

```
 client/jsonapi/url/config = array( 'absoluteUri' => true )
```

The available key/value pairs depend on the application that embeds the e-commerce
framework. This is because the infrastructure of the application is used for
generating the URLs. The full list of available config options is referenced
in the "see also" section of this page.
