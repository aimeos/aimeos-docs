# decorators
## excludes

Excludes decorators added by the "common" option from the catalog filter price html client

```
client/html/catalog/price/decorators/excludes = 
```

* Default: 
* Type: array - List of decorator names
* Since: 2018.04

Decorators extend the functionality of a class by adding new aspects
(e.g. log what is currently done), executing the methods of the underlying
class only in certain conditions (e.g. only for logged in users) or
modify what is returned to the caller.

This option allows you to remove a decorator added via
"client/html/common/decorators/default" before they are wrapped
around the html client.

```
 client/html/catalog/price/decorators/excludes = array( 'decorator1' )
```

This would remove the decorator named "decorator1" from the list of
common decorators ("\Aimeos\Client\Html\Common\Decorator\*") added via
"client/html/common/decorators/default" to the html client.

## global

Adds a list of globally available decorators only to the catalog filter price html client

```
client/html/catalog/price/decorators/global = 
```

* Default: 
* Type: array - List of decorator names
* Since: 2018.04

Decorators extend the functionality of a class by adding new aspects
(e.g. log what is currently done), executing the methods of the underlying
class only in certain conditions (e.g. only for logged in users) or
modify what is returned to the caller.

This option allows you to wrap global decorators
("\Aimeos\Client\Html\Common\Decorator\*") around the html client.

```
 client/html/catalog/price/decorators/global = array( 'decorator1' )
```

This would add the decorator named "decorator1" defined by
"\Aimeos\Client\Html\Common\Decorator\Decorator1" only to the html client.

## local

Adds a list of local decorators only to the catalog filter price html client

```
client/html/catalog/price/decorators/local = 
```

* Default: 
* Type: array - List of decorator names
* Since: 2018.04

Decorators extend the functionality of a class by adding new aspects
(e.g. log what is currently done), executing the methods of the underlying
class only in certain conditions (e.g. only for logged in users) or
modify what is returned to the caller.

This option allows you to wrap local decorators
("\Aimeos\Client\Html\Catalog\Decorator\*") around the html client.

```
 client/html/catalog/price/decorators/local = array( 'decorator2' )
```

This would add the decorator named "decorator2" defined by
"\Aimeos\Client\Html\Catalog\Decorator\Decorator2" only to the html client.

# subparts

List of HTML sub-clients rendered within the catalog price section

```
client/html/catalog/price/subparts = Array
(
    [0] => price
)
```

* Default: Array
* Type: array - List of sub-client names
* Since: 2018.04

The output of the frontend is composed of the code generated by the HTML
clients. Each HTML client can consist of serveral (or none) sub-clients
that are responsible for rendering certain sub-parts of the output. The
sub-clients can contain HTML clients themselves and therefore a
hierarchical tree of HTML clients is composed. Each HTML client creates
the output that is placed inside the container of its parent.

At first, always the HTML code generated by the parent is printed, then
the HTML code of its sub-clients. The order of the HTML sub-clients
determines the order of the output of these sub-clients inside the parent
container. If the configured list of clients is

```
 array( "subclient1", "subclient2" )
```

you can easily change the order of the output by reordering the subparts:

```
 client/html/<clients>/subparts = array( "subclient1", "subclient2" )
```

You can also remove one or more parts if they shouldn't be rendered:

```
 client/html/<clients>/subparts = array( "subclient1" )
```

As the clients only generates structural HTML, the layout defined via CSS
should support adding, removing or reordering content by a fluid like
design.
