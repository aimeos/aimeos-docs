List of social network names that should be displayed in the catalog views

```
client/html/catalog/social/list = Array
(
    [0] => facebook
    [1] => twitter
    [2] => pinterest
)
```

* Default: Array
* Type: array - List of social network names
* Since: 2017.04

Users can share product links in several social networks. The order of the
social network names in the configuration determines the order of the links
on the catalog pages.

You can add more social links only by configuration if you define a
corresponding URL for the added social network. For example, if you would
like to add Tumblr as social network, you also need to configure a link with
the placeholder for the URL:

```
 client/html/catalog/social/list = array( ..., 'tumblr' )
 client/html/catalog/social/url/tumblr = http://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=%1$s&name=%2$s
```

Possible placeholders and replaced values are:
* %1$s : Shop URL of the product detail page
* %2$s : Name of the product
* %3$s : URL of the first product image
